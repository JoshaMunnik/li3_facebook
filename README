This library will allow you to use the Facebook API with the PHP SDK.
Somewhere in your bootstrap, add:

Libraries::add('li3_facebook');

In the library there is a bootstrap file. This file currently houses the code to connect. 
It needs to change. However, for now there is a filter on Dispatcher::run() which will allow a user to login and then a local user record will be saved to the User model.
